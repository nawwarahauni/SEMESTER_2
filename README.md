# SEMESTER_2
Hello and welcome!ðŸ˜„

This semester, I am excited to share my journey as I take on six courses, five of which are essential for my degree programme. Here, you'll find a showcase of my projects, assignments, and reflections on my learning experiences.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work! ðŸŒ

<br/>
## [PROBABILITY AND STATISTICAL DATA ANALYSIS](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/SEMESTER_2/tree/c4e3fbade4fc66d7aa27e5076aa64cc8a361e219/Probability%20and%20Statistical%20Data%20Analysis)
This course introduces the basics of probability and statistics, helping us understand how to deal with uncertainty and make sense of data. Weâ€™ll learn about different types of data and probability distributions, how to test hypotheses, and how to perform statistical data analysis such as regression, correlation and ANOVA. Weâ€™ll also look at real-life examples to see how these concepts are applied. By the end of the course, I able to analyze and understand statistical data better.
<br/>
<br/>
## [PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE II](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/SEMESTER_2/tree/main/Programming%20Technique%20II)
In this course, weâ€™ll build on what we learned in our first programming class and move on to more advanced topics. Weâ€™ll learn about object-oriented programming, how to apply OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism, and critical thinking to solve problems. Weâ€™ll do a lot of coding exercises and projects. This subject helps me to differentiate procedural and object-oriented programming approach better.
<br/>
<br/>
## [COMPUTER ORGANIZATION AND ARCHITRCTURE](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/SEMESTER_2/tree/main/Computer%20Organization%20and%20Architecture)
This course teaches us how computers work on the inside, covering both the hardware and software parts. Weâ€™ll learn about the CPU, memory, and input/output systems, and how they all work together to run programs. By studying these components, weâ€™ll understand how computers are built and how they operate. Through this course, Iâ€™ll have a good understanding of computer performance better.
<br/>
<br/>
## [SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/SEMESTER_2/tree/main/System%20Analysis%20and%20Design)
In this course, we learn how to analyze and design information systems. Weâ€™ll study different modeling techniques, like UML, and how to use them in system development. The course also cover project management and the best practices for creating and implementing systems. We also do one design proposal for KADA corporation system that apply planning, analysis, and design phases in the SDLC to a real-life scenario.
<br/>
<br/>
## [HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/SEMESTER_2/tree/main/Human%20Computer%20Interaction)
This course is about designing user-friendly interfaces and interactions. Weâ€™ll learn about human cognitive and physical abilities to create interfaces that are easy to use and accessible. Some topics we learn are usability testing, user-centered design, and the principles of interaction design. I get to identify user needs and design interfaces that improve the user experience through the projects and assesment in this course.
